# Technical MVP Build Guide

I'll walk you through building a technical MVP that demonstrates your core concept. Think of this as constructing a digital prototype that proves your idea works before investing in the full-scale version. We'll build this incrementally, like learning to play piano—starting with simple melodies before attempting symphonies.

---

## Understanding Our MVP Scope

Before diving into code, let's define exactly what we're building. Our MVP will create a simplified 3D Walmart store section with about **6–8 aisles**, **scattered collectible coins**, and **10–15 real products** with mock inventory data. Users will:

- Navigate the space
- Collect coins for points
- Click on products to see details and add them to a cart

> Think of this like building a model train set—we're creating one detailed section of track rather than attempting to model an entire railway system.

## Technical Foundation and Architecture

We'll use a **three-layer architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer**: 3D visualization & UI using **Three.js**
- **Application Layer**: Game logic, interaction, and state management using **JavaScript**
- **Data Layer**: Mock APIs and **local storage** for user and inventory data

This architecture ensures scalability. Later, only the data layer will need to be swapped for real integration.

## Phase 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Create a project directory.
2. Set up a basic `index.html` with a full-screen `<canvas>` for Three.js.
3. Include UI overlays for:
   - Score
   - Product info
   - Navigation controls

In your main JS file:

- Initialize **Three.js scene**, **camera**, and **renderer**
- Use a **first-person camera perspective** (~5.5 feet height)
- Add **ambient** + **directional lighting**

---

## Phase 2: Building Your Virtual Store Layout

- Create a **large rectangular floor**
- Build **aisles** using `BoxGeometry`
- Place them in parallel with:
  - Aisles: ~4 feet wide
  - Walkways: ~6 feet wide

Use color-coded boxes for departments:

- Blue = Electronics
- Green = Health
- Red = Food

Add **collision detection** to prevent walking through shelves using **bounding box** logic.

---

## Phase 3: Implementing Movement and Navigation

- **WASD controls** for movement:
  - W: Forward
  - S: Backward
  - A: Strafe Left
  - D: Strafe Right

- **Mouse look** for first-person rotation
- Smooth transitions using **interpolation**
- Optional: Add a **minimap** or **compass**

---

## Phase 4: Creating the Coin Collection System

- Use `CylinderGeometry` to place golden disc-like **coins**
- Implement **proximity detection** to:
  - Play a collection sound
  - Remove the coin
  - Increment score

- Add:
  - **Score display overlay**
  - **Visual effects** on collection (particles, flashes)

> MVP can use one-time coin collection without respawn logic.

---

## Phase 5: Product Integration and Shopping Features

- Create **3D product models** with **texture-mapped images**
- On click, open **info panels** with:
  - Product name, price, description, inventory

- Add **cart functionality** with:
  - Cart overlay
  - Total pricing

- Use **mock inventory APIs** to simulate stock fluctuations

---

## Phase 6: User Interface and Experience Polish

- Add UI screens:
  - Welcome
  - Instructions
  - Progress bars

- Build a **pause menu** (with settings, resume, exit)
- Add **keyboard accessibility**
- Design a **tutorial system** for first-time users

---

## Phase 7: Data Persistence and State Management

- Use **localStorage** to persist:
  - Score
  - Collected coins
  - Cart contents

- Implement a simple **user session system**
- Design **extensible data structures** for future real backend integration

---

## Performance Optimization and Testing

- Monitor:
  - Frame rate
  - Memory usage

- Use **Level-of-Detail (LOD)** for faraway objects
- Test on:
  - Multiple browsers
  - Desktop and mobile
